# MEDITATION APP PROJECT
## ABOUT ME 
Hello Everyone. Let me briefly introduce myself to you. First of all I am so glad to see that you are looking at my project. I am 26 years old. I am a mechanical engineer. After my graduation I worked as an engineer in the field somewhere in the region of 5 months. However, after working a few month I felt like it was not for me and I was not happy. After That I decided to research on different careers specifically those that include web development, because I have always been interested in coding, software, computer and its components. After extensive research, I grew more interest towards coding and I felt driven and motivated to become a genuinely brilliant frontend web developer. I would like to add that my education background that engineering has taught me how to work in an higly orginised and systematic way which allows me to learn in an effective way. What I mean is my enginnering background has been making great contrubutions to my learning process. I hope I did not bore you with my brief introduction.

## About The Project
While I was creating my meditation app project my biggest aim was using JavaScript and improve my capability to manipulate DOM. The part of manipulate DOM by clicking buttons and change the video of the background and at the same time change the sound was the most educative part and I learnt from this project a lot. Also the responsibility of the project was really entartaining and educational. I hope you like my project.

Sample of the project: Note : I am aware of that you cannot hear the super relaxing sounds from the project. If you would like to hear and listen them when you want to relax, you can find them above in the sounds file
